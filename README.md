# 30days30sites

30days30sites is a challenge created by Beatrice Bock (Tris) @code413. 

In this challenge participants receive 30 email prompts for 30 days. Each day they get to create a website. Each promote includes an example website and a tutorial as a guideline to follow. Websites could be as simple or as complex depending on participant’s choice and level of expertise. 

There is a Facebook group where participants get to share their work with others to receive feedback on their work. All participants are also encouraged to give feedback on other’s work. 

I believe this challenge is very useful to all aspiring developers. The reason being is that it takes participant's html & css skills from beginner to advanced level. Participants could choose to produce fully responsive websites from scratch with/witout using any frameworks. Having said that, this takes me to my next point. Why I chose to participate in this #30days30sites challenge. 

As an aspiring self-taught developer, I found it was very easy to go down a slippery slope to rush the learning process by using frameworks like bootstrap to build a responsive website, I mean the more work I show to potential employers the more likely I get hired right!? I would argue no, I strongly believe learning the basic of how to code a fully responsive website using only  html&css is the best thing any self-taught developer could do to acquire strong html&css skills. Learning frameworks should be the next step to take along with learning other skills to become a Web Developer. 

My goal:

- Finish the #30days30sites challenge. 
- Take my html&css from beginner to expert. 
- Learn from others, and help others when possible.
- Meet other aspiring developers and possibly collaborate in a big project .
